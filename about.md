I'm currently a Software Engineer for Xendit's Xendisburse product.

### Interests

- DevOps
- Security Practices on Backend
- Quality Assurance (Particulary since I like to stress test things to see where it breaks)
- Chaos Engineering (Even more aligned with my inner chaos monkey)
- Go
- Docker
- Anything new!
