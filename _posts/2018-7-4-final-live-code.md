title: The Boss is Here - Final Live Code Phase 0
---

Preparation to be made. We already got the simulation quizzes from our instructors, and I did my research to get extra quizzes to make time trial. My goal, to solve the Live Code as quick and right as possible.

But unexpected things happens. Somehow the instructions and the description of the problem sometimes didn't match, and numeral of times we are interupted by the corrections. I even almost wrongly answered one problem with another T-T But overall, I feel that I'm doing my very best at the time.

Anyway, I'm sharing [my phase 0 repo](https://github.com/joanlamrack/Uberfox-Hacktiv8-Phase0). hopefully it would be useful for you who are in the Phase 0 as well.
