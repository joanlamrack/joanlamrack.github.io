Hacktiv8 is a bootcamp that will teach and guide you through the process of becoming (of course) a programmer. No, hold on that initial thought that you will hear a lengthy lecture on a class with air-conditioner(s) that made it felt like time to sleep.

In the contrary, the lecture is barebone and direct. What you will most of the time do is programming the task, exploring the materials and IDE, or discussing with peers/lecturer.

That's a bit of Hacktiv8. Now, Why did I join Hacktiv8?

Despite my hesitation for it's price and my own background that seems solid for a programmer (I studied Computer Engineering and worked as IT for 6 months), I do not feel that the programs I made is really effective nor it has some goal. One of the reasons this thoughts came; I watched Linux creator's Interview that analyze and separate "Good Taste" and "Bad Taste" Code. See for yourself the interview below;

That interview made me realize what I'm missing at the first place as a programmer. Logic, problem solving, defining goal and dissecting each steps to a smaller problem. Hence, I joined the bootcamp, putting myself in the shoes of non-IT people. Because no matter what your background is, what programmers do is programming something that will make ( yours and ) other people's life easier.

That's the reason why I joined Hacktiv8.
