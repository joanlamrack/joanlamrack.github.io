It's been a year ever since I wrote back to this blog, and it's certainly been roller coaster ride. I worked with some of smartest peoples in the company, collaborating with multiple teams over various projects, and definitely had seen big fires with the heroic attempts to control it. I wish I could write them all down here, but I don't want to bore you...

Over the time I slowly gaining experience about the workflow in Xendit. I would say Xendit is:
- one of the fastest growing company that I have ever been in --the company size basically had gone two-fold since I joined last year--. this goes for features as well :)
- encouraging some autonomy and ownership towards the product itself. In the team, you would find often that every opinion is heard, therefore influencing our roadmap of the product itself.
- valueing initiative over bureaucracy, which means they embrace flat-shaped organization. We often talked and make friends regardless of which team we are in and what title we hold.

On personal level, I feel that I have a lot to learn in the industry. Ownership means a lot of aggregating knowledge, feedback, then applying it to the product so it can serve the best for the customer. For an Software Engineer like me, this means I had to accumulate the experience and the toolbelt in order to create something that will make biggest impact for people.

I'll make a dent in the Universe, one day.
