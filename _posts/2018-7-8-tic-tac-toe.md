title: Making friendemy with DOM - Tic Tac Toe Project
---

![Tic Tac Toe Demo](/images/gameplay.gif)

Above is the final stuff for my final project. Made using pure dom manipulation with javascript. Pretty cool huh?

You can see the full version [here](/tictactoe)

Anyway, while playing with DOM, I realize some interesting things:

-   That all things we see in browser is actually is what browser render from a bunch of scripts, starting from html, css and javascript....

-   ...Which make the reason why each browser would have slightly different look even when opening same site.

-   DOM is generated when browser parsed the HTML file. But DOM also can be created from the javascript.

-   So no wonder there are Web UI Frameworks like React and Vue that took advantage on DOM creation by Javascript!
