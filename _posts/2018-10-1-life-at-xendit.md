Within days after our graduation from Hacktiv8, I got an interview offer from several startups. One of them in particular in Xendit.

What intriguing about them is that first, I actually already used their product when I paid my bootcamp tuition. This is mindblowing for me, since practically everybody who had joined Hacktiv8 didn't realize that they already used their product. Second, I never heard of them before. Third, there are many bootcamp alumni in there.

So I set up a time for interview with them, hoping for the best.

It was Monday when I arrived super early at the viccinity of their HQ at South Jakarta. I was confused since I don't see anything in particular that signed Xendit or anything. I only see big houses and pretty calm street. Looking back and forth from my Google map and carefully matching the address the recruiter gave me, I entered an opened gate where a Bajaj was parked. It turns out Xendit still have that startup vibe that started out at a garage. Yes, Xendit HQ turns out to be a particular house repurposed for their operational. The keeper there gave me direction to enter the building through the basement's window. Yep, you heard that right. Basement's window! they even got a stair for it.

When I entered the basement, I was welcomed with a pingpong table, open office style, tables with monitors on it. It's really feels like home, warm and cozy all around. Then I decided to explore around the office. I'm more than delighted to find out that they have their own pool! When I'm done exploring, I decided to wait for my interviewer.

The interview went really chill and more like a conversation, compared to the usual ones. I wasn't prepared when I had to use English, since I need time adjusting the linguistic tongue. Luckily I did what I can and in the interview I get more information about what Xendit do and how's their everyday work routine.
